# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zhen, a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Hunter College. 

My [personal website](https://morningzephyr.github.io/Personal-Website/) is still under development, but feel free to listen to some of my [ðŸŽµ piano recordings](https://morningzephyr.github.io/Personal-Website/#music-section)!


While my primary passion is artificial intelligence, I am also keenly interested in Fullstack Development. I'm driven by a curiosity to continuously learn and grow.
